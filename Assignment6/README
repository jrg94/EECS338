-- Assignment 6 as written by Jeremy Griffith --

This solution was based primarily off of the smokers
problem solution from 2013. Many of the same elements
can be seen throughout this solution. For instance,

-- In order to run this solution --

1. Try ./run.sh. This may need to be edited to use
your username and password. Otherwise, this script
will handle building the solution as well as running
it on several remote PCs.
