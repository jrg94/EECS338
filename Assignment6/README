-- Assignment 6 as written by Jeremy Griffith --

This solution was based primarily off of the smokers
problem solution from 2013. Many of the same elements
can be seen throughout this solution. For instance, 
a run.sh file was written to speedup testing. 

-- In order to run this solution --

1. Try ./run.sh. This may need to be edited to use
your username and password. Otherwise, this script
will handle building the solution as well as running
it on several remote PCs.

-- If the above fails --

Each process can be started by hand. For instance, 
try running the following commands into separate
terminals.

./mother
./tina localhost
./judy localhost

-- If all else fails --

Try running a 'make clean' on the directory. 
This will remove all executable binaries, and 
you'll be able to freshly build the project.

You can also try a fresh 'rpcgen cookies.x' on
the directory. This will rewrite the stubs for 
your client and server processes.
